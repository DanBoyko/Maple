# Maple
A group of programs used to conduct research on bosonic Dirac particles. 


There are two seperate structures evaluated in these programs - one is a honeycomb lattice, the other a kagome lattice. 

I have only uploaded the ferromagnetic case, since the other configurations (such as anti-ferromagnetic, zig-zag, armchair) are variations of the same code. 
The only difference is the spin-sites list and the exchange interaction matrices used to evaluate the spin waves.
