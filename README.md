# Maple
A group of programs used to conduct research on bosonic Dirac particles. 


There are two seperate structures evaluated in these programs - one is a honeycomb lattice, the other a kagome lattice. 

I have only uploaded the ferromagnetic case, since the other configurations (such as anti-ferromagnetic, zig-zag, armchair) are variations of the same code. 
The only difference is the spin-sites list and the exchange interaction matrices used to evaluate the spin waves.



FILE FORMAT
The file format is in Maple, however I am currently working on creating a more generalized version of these programs in Python.
In addition, these newer programs will be more generalized and capable of evaluating the spin waves of any lattice structure, given the real space vectors and sub-lattice spins. 
They will also be able to perform Montecarlo simulations to detirmine non-collinear phases.
Ideally, they will also have their own UI and graphing/visualization capabilites.
